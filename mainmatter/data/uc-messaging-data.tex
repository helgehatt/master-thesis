\section{UC Messaging Data}

The UC messaging dataset is comprised of private messages sent on an online social network at the University of California, Irvine. The network comprises a total of 1899 nodes with 59,835 temporal edges over 193 days. Similar to the EU email data, the network is directed, where each edge $(u,v,ts)$ corresponds to user $u$ sending a private message to user $v$ at time $ts$. Aggregating the timestamps to days results in the number of links over time shown in \Cref{Data/UCMessaging/Links}.

Unlike the EU email network, the UC messaging network has significantly less structure, with no distinct periodic patterns. However, considering that the links are from an online messaging platform, the behavior is not entirely unexpected. The initial increase in activity reflects how the platform becomes very popular after its release, exchanging a total of 1,200 messages on a single day at its peak. Unfortunately, the hype is usually quite temporary, such that the activity diminishes to a small group of users after two months.
