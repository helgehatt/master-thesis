\chapter{Data}\label{ch:Data}

Datasets are taken from the \citetitle{snapnets}~\cite{snapnets}, containing hundreds of networks from social networks to collaboration networks as well as various web graphs. The size of the networks ranges from hundred nodes to several millions of nodes, with the largest network having almost two billion edges.
Before testing on real-life networks, synthetic datasets are generated based on the developed models to verify that the models are capable of capturing the underlying processes, as well as giving insight to strengths and weaknesses of the different models.
