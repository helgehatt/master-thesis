- making Ytest symmetric for directed graphs
- remove links and train on Ytest
- false links randomly chosen
- Case-Control Approximate Likelihood not used

c in AR <- reparametrization
static vs diffusion models <- average of multiple predictions - visualization of uncertainty
AR model <- train on multiple overlapping blocks, optimize several sets of initial positions, predict using full model

condition on latent variable vs observed variable

overlapping sequences


bidirectional - depend on whole sequence
cross-validate block size
initialization
not enough links - difficult to capture 

block size - possible to capture the picture with a static view; no dynamicity will be accounted for

# AR(7) The periodic pattern in the number of links over time does not necessarily relate to each individual user, but is an average over all users.
